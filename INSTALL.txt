INTRODUCTION
============

  This is the installation guide for SCPLearn software. Please make sure you have the required 
  dependencies before proceeding.

Quick Summary of Installation
=============================

This software has been primarily implemented for Linux operating systems.

----------------
 Dependencies
----------------
- MATLAB Compiler mcc version 5.2 (R2014B)
- MATLAB R2014B
- Python 2.7.9
- Python library numpy 1.7.2
- Python library scipy 0.15.1
- Python library pandas 0.16.2

Make sure all dependencies are met before proceeding with install.

-------------------------------------
Generating standalone executables
-------------------------------------
1)  Within the src/ directory, run make:

./make

2)  Within the src/ directory, test the code as follows:

./make test

This test runs scplearn on sythetic test images, and compares the results to the ground-truth.
If testing succeeded, you will see the message: 
"Match between results and ground truth xx.xxxx>70% - test passed!", where xx.xx is the percentage match between result and ground-truth.
Proceed to install only if testing is completed.

3) Within the src/ directory, run make install with the location of the install directory as the argument:

./make install <installDir>

4) Add the install directory to your path by running the following command. 

Replace ${installDir} with the location of the install directory from step 1 above.

export PATH=${PATH}:${installDir}

----------------------------
Generating code documentation
----------------------------

The above make install command creates doxygen documentation in "docs/*". Please open "docs/index.html" in you browser.
